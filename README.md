## 🎯 Conclusion
NoteNest isn't just a paste manager — it's a step forward in mastering React and Redux.
Through this project, I learned how to manage global state using Redux Toolkit, route between pages with React Router, and make the user experience smoother with features like search, copy, and toast notifications.
It's proof that even with basic tools and clean UI, you can build something practical, fast, and useful.
